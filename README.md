# Unnamed Group Project

This is a placeholder README for a group project for the MSU edX Coding Bootcamp

## Usage Instructions

- Do `npm install` (this should make your `/node_modules` directory, your `package.json`, and your `package-lock.json` (or maybe that's the next step?? idk))
- Do `npm init` for good measure (just mash `Enter` through the many prompts)
- Then do `npm start` and it should start running in your default browser window, on `http://localhost:3000/`
- (Apparently `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run eject` are also available, but idk what those do. We will inevitably break them as we work on the project, which is fine.)

## Grading Requirements

- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).
- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
